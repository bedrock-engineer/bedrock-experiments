# CesiumJS apps without a CesiumIon token

From Cesium's perspective it's totally understandable that they encourage you to use a Cesium Ion token. Bane Sullivan puts it brilliantly in his [blog post on using CesiumJS without a CesiumIon token](https://blog.banesullivan.com/using-cesiumjs-without-a-cesiumion-token-open-access-tile-providers-a1fa70657319):

> I totally understand why the first step is to create a token, though… Cesium is a commercial company built around their truly fantastic open source CesiumJS library, and they need to make money. What better way to get CesiumJS users embedded in their commercial platform than immediately upon using the free software? This is a brilliant model I would follow if I were offering similar products.

What we need:

- Basemap tiles, map or satellite imagery
- Global terrain
- 3D buildings
